# OpenGL-Base

A small graphics framewok still in progress. The framework builds upon LWJGL 2.9.3 and tries to expose OpenGL in a somewhat simple way.

The framework contains classes and methods for the following OpenGL objects:

- Textures
- Vertex Buffers
- Vertex Arrays
- Frame Buffers
- Shader Programs
